# Stance - Stocks at a glance.

## A project for WDI SF 45 by Kevin Cramer, Aaron Horowitz, and Sharon Paz

Welcome to Stance - Stocks at a glance.

Stance's mission is to deliver up-to-the-minute stock price and chart information, in a simple format, without all of the extra junk found on other stock trading and tracking sites. Stance allows users to sign in and customize the list of stocks on their dashboard, and view historical chart data in increments ranging from one day to five years.
